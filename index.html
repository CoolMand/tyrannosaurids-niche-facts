    <h2>Morphology</h2>
    <p>The tyrannosaur family possessed massive, fused skulls over one metre long with hollow chambers and fenestrae to reduce weight【115627937199117†L391-L399】. Their teeth were heterodont, with D-shaped premaxillary teeth and thick maxillary teeth built for crushing【115627937199117†L426-L434】. A unique structural adaptation in the tooth serrations – called an ampulla – helped prevent crack propagation【115627937199117†L436-L449】.</p>
    <p>The hindlimbs were long, with an <em>arctometatarsus</em> (a pinched third metatarsal) that improved running and turning ability【115627937199117†L470-L491】. Tyrannosauridae is divided into two subfamilies: slender, long-legged Albertosaurines, and robust Tyrannosaurines【115627937199117†L533-L546】.</p>

  <section id="adaptations">
    <h2>Unusual Adaptations</h2>
    <p>Tyrannosaurids had highly sensitive facial skin covered in scales with numerous nerve openings; <em>Daspletosaurus horneri</em> probably used its snout like a sensitive organ【625248213800986†L50-L59】. This tactile sensitivity suggests they could delicately care for nests and young【625248213800986†L90-L110】.</p>
    <p>Evidence of cannibalism has been found in T.rex bones: bite marks and gouges indicate that these large predators sometimes scavenged or ate their own species【731636517590965†L57-L105】.</p>

  <section id="species">
    <h2>Notable Species</h2>
    <h3>Nanuqsaurus</h3>
    <p><em>Nanuqsaurus hoglundi</em>, the “polar bear lizard,” lived above the Arctic Circle. It measured roughly 6–7 metres long – about half the length of T.rex – and likely evolved a smaller body to cope with seasonal food scarcity【812751435596428†L62-L98】.</p>
    <h3>Lythronax</h3>
    <p><em>Lythronax argestes</em>, the “king of gore,” is the oldest known tyrannosaurid. It had a short narrow snout and wide skull that provided forward‑facing eyesight【214110340390093†L66-L97】 and shows that wide-skulled tyrannosaurs evolved earlier than thought【214110340390093†L96-L124】.</p>
    <h3>Tarbosaurus & Alioramus</h3>
    <p><em>Tarbosaurus bataar</em> was a slender Asian cousin of T.rex with a locking jaw mechanism and the smallest arm-to-body ratio among tyrannosaurids【444032025802189†L90-L111】. <em>Alioramus</em> had a long narrow snout with five bony crests and many more teeth than other tyrannosaurids, suggesting it hunted smaller prey【856133311059393†L94-L146】.</p>
    <h3>Qianzhousaurus</h3>
    <p>Known as “Pinocchio rex,” <em>Qianzhousaurus sinensis</em> had a long snout and horns on its nose; it was light and fast, hunting smaller prey【702399461876811†L176-L214】.</p>

  <section id="behavior">
    <h2>Behaviour and Ecology</h2>
    <p>Mass death assemblages of <em>Albertosaurus</em> may suggest some social behaviour, possibly cooperative hunting【2358969337408†L683-L736】. However, interpretations vary and such behaviours are hard to confirm.</p>
    <p>The discovery of tyrannosaur embryos reveals that hatchlings were about 71–110 cm long – roughly the size of a medium dog – and lacked serrated teeth found in adults【516103648566490†L52-L108】.</p>

  <section id="discoveries">
    <h2>Fossil Discoveries & Skin</h2>
    <p>Fossilised skin impressions of several tyrannosaurids show pebbly scales, indicating that large tyrannosaurs were mostly scaly; any feathers were likely sparse【598639776752355†L320-L347】. Early tyrannosaurs may have had feathers, but as body size increased, they were lost for thermoregulation【598639776752355†L344-L372】.</p>
    <p>Other notable finds include the polar tyrannosaur <em>Nanuqsaurus</em> from Alaska【752977661022130†L294-L364】 and the long-snouted <em>Qianzhousaurus</em> from China【702399461876811†L176-L214】, both illustrating the family’s geographic and morphological diversity.</p>
